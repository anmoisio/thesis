Here is my text for the writing group, the reading instructions:

This is a journal version of our challenge paper and it's still a work in progress.

The most important part to read is section 4.4 about feature selection. (The rest will be rewritten soon)

My questions to the readers:

-Is it clear how we utilized input sensitivity analysis to get the important features?

it wasn't always clear if input means the input vector or one  element in the vector

-Is it easy to follow the text?

-Do you find the argument in favor of output gradients instead of loss appealing/logical?

"the loss-based one determines the problematic inputs responsible for the network’s errors."

-Should I keep the equations, or would it be better to explain the method without equations?
keep the equations


--------------------------------

Here is my text for the summer project report.
There are few minor sections still left to be written along with grammar and formatting issues. Primarily I would want feedback on Sections 2, 4 and 5.
Questions to readers-
-Is the description of the methodology okay? Or more explanations are needed?
-Are the experiments easy to follow?
-Are the tables in the Results section too difficult to comprehend?


- the figures could have larger text, preferably same size as the text
- in the tables, each hyperparameter could be separate column
- maybe also normalised result in separate column

--------------------------------

- mention i-vectors and transformer only in background
- enumerate research questions
- lose ASR repetition
- conversational
- specify the questions ()
- specify relative specify
