\section{Finnish conversations to text}

\subsection{Feature extraction}

  The cepstral mean and variance normalization is a method for making the model more robust in noisy conditions \citep{viikki1998cepstral}.

\subsection{Acoustic modelling} 
  In the conventional ASR system, used also in this thesis, phonemes are modelled by HMMs.
  Hidden Markov models are based on the idea that a system goes through sequences of hidden states which cause observations. Each observation has a probability of being generated by each hidden state, and each hidden state pair has a transition probability $t_{ij}$ that describes how probable it is to move from state $i$ to state $j$. 

  % in Kaldi 
  % http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/hmm.html
  The typical HMM topology for a phoneme is a left-to-right model (also called the Bakis model) with three emitting states which each have a transition to the next state and a self-loop. The model also includes a fourth non-emitting final state which has no transitions out of it.

  % Gaussian mixtures
  A state's emission probabilities are represented by a PDF, typically a GMM whose parameters, i.e. its mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ and mixture weights, are estimated in the model training process. An observed feature vector $\boldsymbol{o}_t$ is emitted from a certain state $i$ with an observation likelihood $b_i(\boldsymbol{o}_t)$. 

  The monophone models are first trained (with single-component Gaussians?) and the triphone models are initialised with the monophone model set parameters. The number of Gaussians in the triphone models is increased gradually and the parameters are re-estimated.

  % Baum-Welch algorithm
  The Baum-Welch algorithm is an expectation-maximisation algorithm for estimating the HMM paramters.

  % state tying
  The states of the phoneme HMMs are can be tied together so that the parameters of the output distributions of those states are shared. This makes the estimation of the parameters more robust because there are more training data occurences, and also makes the total system more compact with fewer parameters \citep{young1992general}. States are clustered based on some metric of similarity.   

  % phonetic decision trees
  % http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/tree_externals.html
  In tree-based clustering as described by \citet{young1994tree}, the states are divided into branches in a top-down optimisation procedure. Starting from the root node, the question that maximises the likelihood is selected for the node, with the data on each side of the divide being modelled by a single Gaussian.
  In a phonetic decision trees the questions are about the context of the phone, e.g. "Is the phone on the left of the current phone a fricative?". 

  After the procedure, the leaves of the tree are the state clusters in which the states are tied. In the final stage, leaves can be merged if the likelihood does not decrease more than a threshold value.

  After a tree has been constructed for the states of the triphone models, also previously unseen triphones can be synthesised by traversing the tree to the aprropriate leaf node, i.e. cluster, by answering the questions about that triphone's context and using the tied states of that cluster.


  % transition modelling
  The transition probabilities from a state to another are essentially the counts of the transitions seen in the training corpus.

  % alignments % lda + mllt
  % https://kaldi-asr.org/doc/transform.html
  Linear transformations can be applied either in model-space or feature-space \citep{gales1998maximum}. MLLT and LDA transfors are speaker-independent

  fMLLR transform is speaker- or utterance-specific.

  An alignments is a sequence of transitions that corresponds to an utterance. 

  Speaker adaptive training \citep{povey2008fast}
